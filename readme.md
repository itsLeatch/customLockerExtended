# Custom Locker Extended
This is an extended version of the [CustomLocker](https://github.com/itsLeatch/customLocker.git). Since the google fit API is going to be deprecated, this version removes the dependency on it. The new versions uses google Health Connect. Therefore an app connection via bluetooth is required to sync data. Additionally, some new features and improvements have been added.
To use the android app, please visit the following link: [Box Master](https://github.com/itsLeatch/box_master)
## Features
- lock the box for a defined time period
- tare the weight sensor with known mass
- Lock the box until the desired number of calories has been burned. Afterwards, the internal weight sensor measures how much weight has been removed. The box then automatically calculates the equivalent amount of calories. If more calories are taken out than burned, the box will play a notification sound.
